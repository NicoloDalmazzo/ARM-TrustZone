Devices that implement CCA can produce attestation tokens as described in this memo, which are the basis for trustworthiness assessment of the Confidential Compute environment. This document specifies the CCA attestation token structure and semantics. The CCA attestation token is a profile of the Entity Attestation Token (EAT). This specification describes what claims are used in an attestation token generated by CCA compliant systems, how these claims get serialized to the wire, and how they are cryptographically protected. This informational document is published as an independent submission to improve interoperability with Arm's architecture. It is not a standard nor a product of the IETF.}

  pages={361-381},
  abstract={Attestation is one of the most critical mechanisms in confidential computing (CC). We present a holistic verification approach enabling comprehensive and rigorous security analysis of architecturally-defined attestation mechanisms in CC. Specifically, we analyze two prominent next-generation hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), namely Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) and Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). For both of these solutions, we provide a comprehensive specification of all phases of the attestation mechanism, namely provisioning, initialization, and attestation protocol. We demonstrate that including the initialization phase in the formal model leads to a violation of integrity, freshness, and secrecy properties for Intel’s claimed trusted computing base (TCB), which could not be captured by considering the attestation protocol alone in the related work. We open-source our artifacts. Other researchers, including a team from Intel, are adopting our artifacts for further analysis.},
