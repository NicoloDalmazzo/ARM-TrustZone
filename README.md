# ARM TrustZone
## Open questions
- Use CCA or TrustZone?
- Study the implementation of the third mode/world?

## Summary
- TrustZone vs CCA focusing on problems of TrustZone and how they are patched with CCA
- RME architecture
- Attestation/Remote attestation
- Software and firmware

## Presentation Summary
- why TEE
- TrustZone introduction (and attestation?)
- trustzone downsides (not isolation between applications and not a root state)
- background knowledge (mpe, gpt, exception model...)
- Arm CCA motivations (repeat shortly)
- companies involved (arm, linaro, huawei, CCC)
- Arm CCA architecture hardware (rmi, hes)
- Arm CCA architecture software (rmm, secure monitor, hes sw)
- TrustZone vs CCA (features and downsides) (pro vs cons)
- attestation trustzone vs cca (maybe do some introduction on turstzone before)
- summary and use case (namely, scenarios in which CCA is better)
- future direction (personal considerations?)

## Logistic
- Max 40 pages for Lioy, the imprtant thing is to have material and do not do a long write without material

## Slide Format
- Font Size: 20 
- Slide Format: A4 
- Font: one of the sans serif font
- 10-15 minutes for each person, more or less 1 slide per minute (?)
- pictures are appreciated if big enough
- deliverable: Latex report + presentation or longer presentation (add doi of documents)
